## Setup

**1. Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

**2. Run the server**
```bash
npm start
```

**3. Open the setup wizard**

Visit `http://localhost:3000/setup` and fill in your info — name, description, social links, Discord, Last.fm, profile image, and background.

The wizard saves everything and locks itself after the first run. To reconfigure, delete `.setup-complete` and restart.

**4. Done**

Your page is live at `http://localhost:3000`.

> **Migrating from a previous version?** Rename `.env.example` to `.env`, fill it in manually, then run `npm run config` to generate `public/js/config.js` without going through the wizard.
